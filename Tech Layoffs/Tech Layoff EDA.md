The global tech layoff dataset, covering the period from the beginning of COVID-19 (March 11, 2020) to the present (July 20, 2024), was cleaned in SQL during the first part of the project. (See <a href="https://github.com/NahyeMoon/DataAnalyticsPortfolio/blob/main/Tech%20Layoffs/Tech%20Layoff%20Cleaning.md">Tech Layoff Cleaning.md></a>) In this second part, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the cleaned dataset using SQL and visualized the results with Power BI.
